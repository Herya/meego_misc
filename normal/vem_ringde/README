"Vem Ringde" is a Swedish app for looking up numbers against a database of annoying phone 
marketeers and such.


* Current State

The app is unfinished. It can download number list from internet and run seraches against it, 
but it can not warn users while the phone is ringing or check the dial history (is there even 
a MeeGo API for those?). 

Also all the misc. fucntions such as the about page and the history page are missing.
